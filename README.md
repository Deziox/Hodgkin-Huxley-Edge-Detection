# Hodgkin Huxley Edge Detection

### Demo Vid:
What you'll see in this demo is a first attempt at implementing the hidden layer of a hodgkin huxley inspired model for edge detection using gabor filters for receptive fields.

The model was taken from this paper by Yedjour et al.

DOI 10.1007/s10339-017-0803-z

For each gabor filter, we simulate 128 x 128 = 16384 neurons, where the applied external current is taken from the greyscaled values of the stimulus image.
